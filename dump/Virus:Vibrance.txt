Like a dog whistle tearing my patience
From the charades of the day to day phases
I salivate to the pulse of the chaos I paint with these brain waves: infinite

If you can't relate, stay the fuck away
Some people get it some people go deeper

Iâ€™ve got a nuclear weapon called self actualization
60/20 inner vision
Aim inside and blast the glass ceiling

If you can't relate, stay the fuck away
Some people get it some people go deeper

Just blur your eyes and fall deep inside
And if you get it, then get it
Let it invade your mind

This is the vibrance
The virus of energy
You cannot save me
I'm already saved
